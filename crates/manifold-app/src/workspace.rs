//! [`Workspace`] — per-UI-window state.
//!
//! A "workspace" is a window that hosts a `UIRoot` (the manifold-ui tree,
//! input system, panels, and offscreen render target). Distinct from the
//! `Output` window, which is content-thread-owned blit-only and has no
//! UIRoot.
//!
//! The main app holds one workspace directly (the timeline/inspector
//! window). Phase 4 of the node-graph editor lands a second optional
//! workspace (`Application::graph_editor`).

/// What kind of UI a workspace is hosting. Drives input routing and
/// per-window render specialization (e.g. only `Main` blits the
/// compositor preview into its UI offscreen).
